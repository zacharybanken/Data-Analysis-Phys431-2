    "\n",
    "This is a good idea at the beginning of your notebook to include the packages that you will need.  We will use the four shown below here.  A brief description:\n",
    "* `numpy` is the foundational package for Python numerical work. It extends and speeds up array operations beyond standard Python, and it includes almost all math functions that you would need for example `sqrt()` (square root) or `cos()` (cosine).  These would be written in code as `np.sqrt()` or `np.cos()`.\n",
    "* `scipy` is a huge collection of scientific data analysis functions, routines, physicical constants, etc.  This is the second most used package for scientific work. Documentation is at [SciPy.org](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/) with the constants subpackage at https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/constants.html.\n",
    "* `uncertainties` is a very useful small package that simplifies uncertainty propagation and printing out of quantities with uncertainty.  Documentation is at https://pythonhosted.org/uncertainties/\n",
    "* `matplotlib` is *the* standard plotting package for scientific Python.  We will use a subset called `pyplot` which is modeled after the plotting functions used in MATLAB. The last line below, `%matplotlib inline`, simply forces the plots to appear within the notebook.\n",
    "* `pandas` is a large data science package.  It's main feature is a set of methods to create and manipulate \"Dataframes\", which is an enlargement of the idea of an array.  It plays well with NumPy and other packages.  We will use it mainly as a way to read files into data sets in an easy way.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also be using the [**LMFit**](https://lmfit.github.io/lmfit-py/) curve fitting package.  This library is very powerful and relatively easy to use to perform complex fitting of functions to data sets, and to also extract meaningful values for statistical uncertainties in the fitting parameters.  It will be introduced and imported later in the template.  Documentation is at https://lmfit.github.io/lmfit-py/"
